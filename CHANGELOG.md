## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Implemented public landing pages as Blade views under `resources/views/landing/`.
- Created modular includes to mirror `landing-pages/includes/`:
  - `landing/includes/head.blade.php`, `header.blade.php`, `nav-desktop.blade.php`, `nav-mobile.blade.php`, `sticky.blade.php`, `footer.blade.php`, `scripts.blade.php`.
  - Forms: `form-signup.blade.php`, `form-login.blade.php`.
  - Homepage content: `landing/includes/main.blade.php`.
- Added public pages:
  - `/` → `landing.home`
  - `/login` → `landing.login`
  - `/sign-up` → `landing.sign-up`
  - `/privacy` → `landing.privacy`
  - `/terms` → `landing.terms`
  - `/cookie` → `landing.cookie`
- Added legal content partials under `resources/views/landing/pages/`.

### Changed
- Refactored layout `resources/views/layouts/landing.blade.php` to include new modular includes and match the static HTML structure.
- Updated `routes/web.php` to register routes for public pages.
- Updated `README.md` with landing pages structure, routes, and next steps.

### Notes
- Static assets are served from `public/landing-pages/` and referenced via `asset()`.
- Legacy partials under `resources/views/partials/` are no longer used by public pages.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-12

### Added
- Installed Laravel 12 application skeleton.
- Installed Filament 4 for the admin panel.
- Configured Filament to use the default `web` guard and `users` table.

### Removed
- Previously generated custom admin resources and their database tables (Leads, Pixels, Pixel Events, Cloaking Rules, Traffic Logs) to keep the codebase clean.

### Changed
- Cleaned configuration and caches.

### Notes
